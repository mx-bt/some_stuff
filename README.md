### Hi, I'm a Operations Mgt. student and this is my code repo.
#### It exclusively contains university projects and exercises from Project Euler, Programming for Computations - Python and HackerRank.

- `hm3` A machine learning project with a browser interface using streamlit. Also plenty of exercises on mathematical computations and basic python syntax.
- `icts` A project to make up to three robots connect via wifi and make them dance with each other, both with programmed routines but also via joystick steering. Further, some exercise scribbles from HackerRank.
- `mbtm_project/robot` Creation of a minimum viable product for a digital twin of a robot including a implementation of A* algorithmn and a battery life prediction on real time data.
- `production_worker_app` Contains the backend script and data pipeline for a mobile app (interface for a production planning and value stream mapping software).
