### Hi, I'm an Operations Mgt. student and this is my code repo.
#### It contains the results of my university projects, the scribbles of some coding exercises and is exclusively Python code.
#### Topics: Data Science and Data Processing, Graphics with Python

- `hm3` A machine learning project with a browser interface using streamlit. Also plenty of exercises on mathematical computations and basic python syntax.
- `icts` A project to make up to three robots connect via wifi and make them dance with each other, both with programmed routines but also via joystick steering. Further, some exercise scribbles from HackerRank.
- `mbtm_project/robot` Creation of a minimum viable product for a digital twin of a robot including a implementation of A* algorithmn and a battery life prediction on real time data.
- `production_worker_app` Contains the backend script and data pipeline for a mobile app (interface for a production planning and value stream mapping software).
- `int_logistics` Transition of an algorithmn described in a VDI (association of German engineers) paper into easy-to-use python program. Also includes scripts to visualize quantitative material streams in a warehouse.
- `da` Data Analysis and Data Science assignments, including visualization of weather data, analysis of influence factors on obesity and a prediction model for bike rentals.
